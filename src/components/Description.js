          During a school field trip to Columbia University, a genetically
          enhanced spider bit me. And then I discover that spider has granted me
          superhuman abilities of a spider, and I started putting my powers to
          good use after witnessing my uncle get killed. Recent events with
          Mysterio revealed my identity.
